Hi 👋 
I'm Philip, a nerd at ❤ and currently a product manager at @Bayer-Group. I programmed since I was 10 and I really like open data and open source software: OpenStreetMap, Mozilla Common Voice to name a few.
I usually create smaller fixes, bug reports and other stuff here, so there are few source repos there.

If you are a recruiter, don't bother, I'm quite happy with my job :)
